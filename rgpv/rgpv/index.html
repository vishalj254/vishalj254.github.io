                    The scope of food processing is vast compared to other courses. The concept of food processing must be done while simultaneously ensuring that the nutrients are retained. People who are well aware of the basics of food processing can apply for posts related to food processing like canning, dairy and food processing, food packaging, frozen food/refrigeration and thermal-processing. Some of the sub-sectors where you can look for jobs are Fruits and Vegetable processing, Fisheries, Milk and Milk Products, Meat and Poultry. The job opportunities in food processing are directly connected to agriculture and food production. In this field, one can expect his or her salary to range from approximately 5 to 7 lakhs per annum.
